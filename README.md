This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

I decided to take my [Startup Generator](https://github.com/andrews1022/startup-generator) app, which was the first JavaScript app I built, and rebuild it using React to have be my first React app!

I built this using what I've learned in React so far, which is passing data through props, managing state, and using the Create React App to import/export components allowing for better modularity!
