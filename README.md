I decided to take my [Startup Generator](https://github.com/andrews1022/startup-generator) app, which was the first JavaScript app I built, and rebuild it using React to have it be my first React app!

I built this using what I've learned in React so far, which is passing data through props, managing state, and importing/exporting components allowing for better modularity!

The random value arrays are small for now, will potentially expand upon them later.

## Update: August 8, 2020

I re-wrote the Generate component using the useState hook
